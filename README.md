# 🏡 Ames Housing Dataset – A Data Cleaning & EDA Showcase

Welcome to my in-depth analysis and preprocessing of the **Ames Housing Dataset** – a modern housing dataset that goes beyond the classic Boston Housing dataset. This project showcases my ability to clean real-world data, handle missing values thoughtfully, engineer meaningful features, and explore data-driven patterns — all essential steps before any machine learning or predictive modeling.

> 💡 **Why this project?**  
> I chose this dataset to build a solid foundation in data preprocessing and EDA, focusing on understanding the structure of a rich housing dataset and preparing it for future modeling.

## 📌 Objectives

- ✅ Understand the structure of the Ames housing data
- 🧹 Clean and preprocess the dataset thoroughly
- 📊 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and outliers
- 📁 Prepare the dataset for use in regression modeling or other ML tasks

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashanknecrothapa/ames-housing-dataset) contains **2,930 observations** and **80 features** describing residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

It includes:
- **Nominal features** like `Neighborhood`, `RoofStyle`, etc.
- **Ordinal features** like `ExterQual`, `KitchenQual`, etc.
- **Continuous features** like `GrLivArea`, `LotFrontage`, etc.
- **Target**: `SalePrice`

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python**
  - `Pandas` & `NumPy` for data wrangling
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` for visualization
  - `Statsmodels` for statistical inspection
- **Google Colab** for notebook execution and file handling

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Inspection
- Dataset loaded from Google Drive and verified using `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.info()` and `.describe()`.
- Initial checks for data shape and variable types.

### 2. Cleaning the Data
- Removed extreme outliers in `GrLivArea` that had unusual sales prices.
- Converted `MSSubClass` to string to better reflect its categorical nature.
- Handled missing values by:
  - Dropping features with >50% missing
  - Filling others based on context (mode, median, or 'None')
- Used helper functions to streamline imputation.

### 3. Feature Understanding
- Identified numerical vs categorical features.
- Separated ordinal and nominal variables for tailored treatment.
- Re-categorized and renamed columns where necessary.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Used visualizations to understand:
  - Sale price distribution
  - Correlation between variables
  - Outliers that needed treatment
- Observed patterns between `SalePrice` and variables like `GrLivArea`, `OverallQual`, and `Neighborhood`.

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- 🏠 Outliers can significantly affect statistical summaries and model performance.
- 🧼 Proper handling of missing data is critical for unbiased modeling.
- 🔀 Converting feature types (e.g., numerical to categorical) prevents misleading assumptions by models.
- 📉 Some high-missing features, although interesting, are better dropped to maintain data quality.

## ✅ Next Steps

This project was focused on **cleaning and exploring** the dataset. Future improvements might include:

- Training a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost)
- Using pipelines to automate preprocessing
- Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation
